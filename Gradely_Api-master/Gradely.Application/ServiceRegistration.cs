    /// WHY?
    ///   Same idea as InfrastructureServiceRegistration — keeps Program.cs clean.
    ///   Each layer is responsible for registering its own services.
    /// 
    /// WHAT GETS REGISTERED:
    ///   IAuthService       → AuthService
    ///   IAssignmentService → AssignmentService
    ///   ISubmissionService → SubmissionService
    ///   SubmissionService  → SubmissionService (concrete type for SubmitWithFileAsync)
    /// 
    /// ALL ARE SCOPED:
    ///   Scoped = a new instance is created for each HTTP request.
    ///   This matches the lifetime of DbContext and UnitOfWork.
